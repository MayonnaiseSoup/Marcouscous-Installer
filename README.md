# Marcouscous-Installer
Marcouscous Installer is a simple Java program that uses the JGit library to download my 3 top repositories! Just download and run!

# What it does

Marcouscous Installer gives you the choice to download 3 of my personal favourite GitHub repositories, without having to have git preinstalled! It is fast, extremely simple and just works!

# Why did I make this?
I made this to learn some Java (I'm new to the language), and get familiar with using Eclipse + Maven. For such a simple Java program, I could not get my .jar file working for AGES. I eventually fixed it though!

# Marcouscous-Installer vs Dark-Light-Installer

For context, Dark-Light installer is a repository that downloads one of my repos. Dark-light Installer wasn't great because of the fact that it required you to have git installed and required the use of system() calls, which is inferior as it uses an exccessive amount of memory. It was made in C++, which meant that it wasn't multiplatform, it only supports MacOS and Linux.
Dark-Light only gave you the choice to install one of my repos, Marcouscous Installer gives you 3 choices. I strongly recommend Marcouscous Installer over Dark-Light installer.

# Prerequisites

All you need is Java downloaded, which most computers come pre-installed with!


# Future Updates??????
Maybe. Now that I have all my settings for eclipse, maven etc set up, updates should be extremely simple to implement.
